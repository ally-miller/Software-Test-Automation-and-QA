1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

    To make sure that my code is functional and secure I first test it in different situations to check if it does what it is supposed to do. I also use tools that scan for problems in my code.  I follow good practices like making sure the data my program gets is safe and keeping sensitive information hidden.

2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

	To interpret user needs and incorporate them into my program I would talk with users and get their ideas for what they are looking for. Then I try to figure out what the more important things they are looking for are. Then I would create a design and show it to the users to see if I am on the right track. Then I would create tests to ensure the functionality of the program and keep checking in with users to make sure they are still happy with the software. 
   
3. How do I approach designing software?

	When I design software, I start by understanding what the software needs to do and who will be using it. Then I talk to the people who will use the software to get their input. Then I will break down the software into manageable parts, so it is easier to work on. While I build the software, I keep testing it to make sure it is working as intended.
